  // Read a signal value by calling itâ€” signals are functions.
  // console.log(title());

  // Change the value of this signal by calling its `set` method with a new value.
  // title.set('Jaime');

  // You can also use the `update` method to change the value
  // based on the previous value.
  // firstName.update(name => name.toUpperCase()); 


  //Computed expression
  //  A computed is a signal that produces its value based on other signals.

  //  const titleCapitalized = computed(() => title().toUpperCase());
  // console.log(titleCapitalized()); // ABDULLAH
